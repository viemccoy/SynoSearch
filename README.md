Designed to make search engines useful again, SynoSearch is the first AI-powered top-down semantic search. Most useful when aiding in the creative literature review process, SynoSearch doesn't ask you to change your habits. There's no chat, just a subtle AI-powered search improvement. SynoSearch is the ultimate research tool, and helps you to get better results with less searches.

SynoSearch works by leveraging existing search tools, such as wildcards and synonym markers. By applying this intelligently using a gpt-3.5 fine tune, results are signficantly improved.
